== Math! (imported from math.typ)
In case you need to include some math, the amsmath package 2 is already included in
this document. To properly display some short formula like $e^(i pi) = âˆ’1$, you should
use the embedded math environment using \$e^(i pi) = -1\$. For longer equations place two spaces around the inner body to make it look like the following one:
$ arrow(Delta) times arrow(B) = mu_0 arrow(j) + mu_0 epsilon_0 diff(arrow(E))/diff(t) $
Welcome to the end!
